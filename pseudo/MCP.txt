I need to create a MCP server for the PostgreSQL database.

The MCP server should be able to handle the following:

- Search for customers by name
- Search for accounts by customer ID
- Search for transactions by account ID
- Search for transactions by customer ID
- Search for transactions by account ID (example: )

can you see what is in the postgressql customer dm on localhost 5000?


are we using the genai toolbox or mcp-playground as our archtectureal implementation?


you are deleteing a ton of code that is vaulable system prompts and what not.

Why couldn't we have done this with genai toolbox?


echo -e "\n=== Get genai-toolbox container IP directly ==="
docker inspect graphrag-kyc-agent-genai_toolbox-1
 --format='{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}'

echo -e "\n=== Alternative method to get IP ==="
docker inspect graphrag-kyc-agent-genai_toolbox-1 | grep -i ipaddress

echo -e "\n=== Check port mapping ==="
docker port graphrag-kyc-agent-genai_toolbox-1

echo -e "\n=== Test connectivity from host to container ==="
CONTAINER_IP=$(docker inspect graphrag-kyc-agent-genai_toolbox-1 --format='{{range .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}')
echo "Container IP: $CONTAINER_IP"

if [ ! -z "$CONTAINER_IP" ]; then
    echo "Testing connection to container IP..."
    curl -v http://$CONTAINER_IP:5000/health 2>&1 || echo "Direct IP connection failed"
    
    echo -e "\nTesting localhost connection..."
    curl -v http://localhost:5000/health 2>&1 || echo "Localhost connection failed"
    
    echo -e "\nTesting 127.0.0.1 connection..."
    curl -v http://127.0.0.1:5000/health 2>&1 || echo "127.0.0.1 connection failed"
else
    echo "Could not retrieve container IP"
fi

echo -e "\n=== Check what's listening on port 5000 ==="
# For Linux/Mac
netstat -tulpn 2>/dev/null | grep :5000 || echo "netstat not available or no listeners on port 5000"

# Alternative for systems without netstat
ss -tulpn 2>/dev/null | grep :5000 || echo "ss not available or no listeners on port 5000"

# For Mac users
lsof -i :5000 2>/dev/null || echo "lsof not available or no listeners on port 5000"




Great — the SQL tools are visible. Ask the copilot things that map directly to the two SQL tools we exposed:
Find a customer by name (uses search-customers-by-name)
“Find ‘John Smith’ in the SQL DB and return id, email, phone, address, risk_score.”
“Search SQL for customers with name containing ‘John’ and show all columns.”
Find high‑risk customers (uses search-customers-by-risk-score)
“Find customers with a risk_score ≥ 8 and list id, name, email, phone, address.”
“List customers with risk_score ≥ 9 and sort by risk_score desc.”
Cross‑source checks (forces graph + SQL comparison per agent instructions)
“Compare ‘John Smith’ between SQL and the Neo4j graph; show differences.”
“For SQL customers with risk_score ≥ 8, check the graph for alerts and summarize.”
Expected hits from your SQL seed:
John Smith (CUST_06595, risk 8)
Michael Chen (CUST_01819, risk 9)
Copy/paste one of the prompts above into the KYC Copilot chat.
